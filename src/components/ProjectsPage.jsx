      description: "Every Sunday, families, students, and volunteers in our church community needed a reliable ride, but coordinating all those moving pieces manually was time-consuming and error-prone. I built a smart scheduler that took over the heavy lifting: it pulls ride requests directly from a Google Form, calculates travel distances using Google Maps, and matches riders with volunteer drivers based on route proximity and seat availability. The result? A fully automated system that produces optimized weekly rosters in minutes instead of hours, giving organizers more time to focus on what matters.",

So, I created a budgeting tool designed for students like me.. simple, intuitive, and focused. Built with React and real-time state management, this tracker helps users monitor spending across customizable categories and stay on top of their financial goals. It‚Äôs a small project with a big purpose: putting financial clarity within reach, one line item at a time.",
